# Python DjangoInspire Green Theme for Visual Studio Code

## Python theme from old-time Komodo IDE green theme DjangoInspire

Long time ago it was a nice green color theme for Komodo IDE, found on KolorModo.com (now disappeared).

With this theme I started my first steps in Python projects for customers so this is like a warm memories for me. Unfortunately this color scheme (djangoinspire.ksf) is not available on the web anymore... (If somebody has this file - I would appreciate sending this to me). Now I respawned this beautiful green color theme.

Enjoy!
